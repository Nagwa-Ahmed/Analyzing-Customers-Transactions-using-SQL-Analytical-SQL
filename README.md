# Analyzing Customers Transactions using SQL (Analytical SQL)

The aim of this project is to leverage SQL and analytical SQL (Window Functions) to analyze customer data and address various questions:

### Questions to Answer:
- 💡 What is the number of orders per year?
- 💡 What is the total sales per year?
- 💡 Average price for a product over the years?
- 💡 Top 10 products in terms of sales?
- 💡 When was the last time each customer made an order?

### Customer Segmentation:
To delve deeper into our analysis, we segmented customers based on recency (how recent the last transaction?), frequency (how many times the customer has bought from our store?), and monetary value (how much each customer has paid for our products). Combining these metrics, we categorized our customers into the following groups:
- 🎯 Champions
- 🎯 Loyal Customers
- 🎯 Potential Loyalists
- 🎯 Recent Customers
- 🎯 Promising Customers
- 🎯 Customers Needing Attention
- 🎯 At Risk Customers
- 🎯 Can't Lose Them Customers
- 🎯 Hibernating Customers
- 🎯 Lost Customers

### Additional Questions:
Utilizing another table with customer data, we addressed additional questions:
- 💡 What is the maximum number of consecutive days a customer made purchases?
- 💡 On average, how many days/transactions does it take a customer to reach a spending threshold of 250 L.E.?
